# Amazon Athena Cassandra Connector

#### _UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

This connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) instance(s), making your Cassandra data accessible via SQL. 

> Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed, NoSQL database. It presents a partitioned wide column storage model with eventually consistent semantics.
> -- _[From Cassandra Architecture Overview](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/overview.html)_

**To enable this Preview feature you need to create an Athena workgroup named AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality and run any queries attempting to federate to this connector, use a UDF, or SageMaker inference from that workgroup.**

## Usage

### Parameters

The Athena AWS Cassandra Connector provides several configuration options via Lambda environment variables. More detail on the available parameters can be found below.

1. **spill_bucket** - When the data returned by your Lambda function exceeds Lambda’s limits, this is the bucket that the data will be written to for Athena to read the excess from. (e.g. my_bucket)
2. **spill_prefix** - (Optional) Defaults to sub-folder in your bucket called 'athena-federation-spill'. Used in conjunction with spill_bucket, this is the path within the above bucket that large responses are spilled to. You should configure an S3 lifecycle on this location to delete old spills after X days/Hours.
3. **kms_key_id** - (Optional) By default any data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using AES-GCM and a randomly generated key. Setting a KMS Key ID allows your Lambda function to use KMS for key generation for a stronger source of encryption keys. (e.g. a7e63k4b-8loc-40db-a2a1-4d0en2cd8331)
4. **disable_spill_encryption** - (Optional) Defaults to False so that any data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using AES-GMC either with a randomly generated key or using KMS to generate keys. Setting this to false will disable spill encryption. You may wish to disable this for improved performance, especially if your spill location in S3 uses S3 Server Side Encryption. (e.g. True or False)
5. _**more to come**_ - .............
